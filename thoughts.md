Takeaways from the first few sessions:
  1) We are going hard from the get-go. Time management will be very
    important starting immediately.
  2) Everybody seems really nice and I feel like I can ask for help when
     I need it.

Two new strategies I am committing to trying for Mod 0:
  1) Reviewing previous session as prep for the upcoming sessions.
  2) Working on Mod 1 pre-work for at least an hour every day.

Shoutout:
  1) I want to give Wil Huffman a shoutout for volunteering my idea
    in the session 1 calendar breakout exercise and giving me credit.
    That definitely made me feel supported!
